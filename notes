# project 1
create base url and ignore example tests in cypress.json
in order to test the applictaion we must select elements first
key methods: Get, Contains, Child
test files contain blocks and blocks contain related tests
blocks are made with context or describe and take a title and a function that executes tests
getting elements is  an assertion
we can specify commands to simplify our code and automate repetitive tasks
**contains only gets one element
*** keep in mind that the app may chnage in the future and tests should be wrtten
accordingly with specificity in mind

# project 2
mock http request to test server/dynamic data
using intercept and fixtures files
